# Industry Realism

![Preview](thumbnail.png)

**Tested With V3 Version: 1.6.2**

- Reworks buildings that have multiple potential outputs to only have one primary output
- Creates a new building type for the alternate outputs
- Some building inputs were changed to be more historically accurate
- Places those new buildings in appropriate states on the starting map
- Updates companies and events around those buildings in ways that hopefully make sense
- Adds some buildings for artificially creating oil and rubber, quite far in the tech tree, to make playing tall more viable

Full list of changes:

- Food Industry: now only produces groceries
- Distillery: new building uses sugar to produce rum, or grain to produce grain alcohol (vodka, beer, sake, etc.), both represented by generic "liquor" good
- Textile Mills: now only produces normal clothing
- Tailoring Workshop: new building produces luxury clothing
- Furniture Manufacturies: now only produces normal furniture
- Luxury Furniture Manufacturies: new building produces luxury furniture
- Glassworks: now only produces glass
- Pottery Mills: new building produces porcelain
- Synthetics Plants: now called dye plants, they produce dye from coal
- Rayon Plants: new building, produces synthetic silk from wood
- Motor Industry: now only makes engines
- Automobile Factory: new building, makes automobiles from engines, oil, rubber, and steel
