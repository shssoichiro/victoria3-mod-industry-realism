# Industry Realism

![Preview](thumbnail.png)

**Tested With V3 Version: 1.6.2**

- Reworks buildings that have multiple potential outputs to only have one primary output
  - Except shipyards. Why? Shipyards represent a technological progression. All of the other buildings represent _two separate outputs_ that should be coming from two separate factories.
- Creates a new building type for the alternate outputs
- Some building inputs were changed to be more historically accurate
- Places those new buildings in appropriate states on the starting map
- Updates companies and events around those buildings in ways that hopefully make sense
- Adds some buildings for artificially creating oil and rubber, quite far in the tech tree, to make playing tall more viable
