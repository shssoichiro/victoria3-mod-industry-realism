# Industry Realism

![Preview](thumbnail.png)

**Tested With V3 Version: 1.6.2**

Reworks buildings that have multiple potential outputs to only have one primary output, and creates a new building type for the alternate outputs. Also places those new buildings in appropriate states on the starting map. Adds some buildings for artificially creating oil and rubber, quite far in the tech tree, to make playing tall more viable.

Full list of changes:

- Food Industry: now only produces groceries
- Distillery: new building produces liquor
