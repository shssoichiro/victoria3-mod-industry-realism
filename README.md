# Industry Realism

![Preview](thumbnail.png)

**Tested With V3 Version: 1.6.2**

- Reworks buildings that have multiple potential outputs to only have one primary output
  - Except shipyards. Why? Shipyards represent a technological progression. All of the other buildings represent _two separate outputs_ that should be coming from two separate factories.
- Creates a new building type for the alternate outputs
- Some building inputs were changed to be more historically accurate
- Places those new buildings in appropriate states on the starting map
- Updates companies and events around those buildings in ways that hopefully make sense
- Adds some buildings for artificially creating oil and rubber, quite far in the tech tree, to make playing tall more viable

### Full list of building changes:

- Food Industry: now only produces groceries
- Distillery: new building uses sugar to produce rum, or grain to produce grain alcohol (vodka, beer, sake, etc.), both represented by generic "liquor" good
- Textile Mills: now only produces normal clothing
- Tailoring Workshop: new building produces luxury clothing
- Furniture Manufacturies: now only produces normal furniture
- Luxury Furniture Manufacturies: new building produces luxury furniture
- Glassworks: now only produces glass
- Pottery Mills: new building produces porcelain
- Synthetics Plants: now called dye plants, they produce dye from coal
- Rayon Plants: new building, produces synthetic silk from wood
- Motor Industry: now only makes engines
- Automobile Factory: new building, makes automobiles from engines, oil, rubber, and steel
- War Machines Industry: now only makes tanks
- Aircraft Industry: new building, makes aeroplanes
- Electrics Industry: renamed to Telephone Industry, now only makes telephones
- Radio Industry: new building, makes radios
- All Farms: no longer have the option to produce fruit
- Fruit Orchards: new farm building, produces fruit
- Livestock Ranches: now only produce meat and a small amount of fertilizer. input goods have also been rebalanced. cows and pigs eat a lot.
- Wool Farms: new building, produces fabric and a small amount of fertilizer
- Logging Camps: now only produce wood
- Hardwood Logging Camps: new building, produces hardwood. some logging camps were converted to hardwood logging camps, based on realistic locations
- Synthetic Rubber Plants: new building, unlocks from Plastics, produces rubber from liquor and sulfur ([historical precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybutadiene#History))
- Synthetic Fuel Plants: new building, unlocks from Electric Arc Process, produces oil from coal and iron ([historical precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process#History))

### Why no synthetic this or that?

There simply wasn't historic precedent for things such as synthetic coffee, tea, or opium. Synthetic opiates, for example, were not invented until 1960, which does not fit the timeframe of the game. Other materials, such as sulfur, made more sense to add in more states throughout the world, as sulfur only occurs naturally and there are merely different processes for extracting it.

### Industry Expanded exists, why waste time on this, idiot?

I wanted a mod that does not introduce any new goods. Industry Expanded is a great mod, it's simply not what I'm looking for. I wanted something lighter weight. You're free to choose whichever one you prefer.

TODO:

- Cross check all the shit with mods
- Starting building locations
